# 🏆 TimeToGoal

**TimeToGoal** is a modern iOS application built with **SwiftUI** and **MVVM**, designed to help users create goals, track progress, stay motivated with streaks, and build long-term habits.

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I designed and developed the entire application end-to-end, including:

- **Full UI/UX design**  
  (visual identity, layouts, navigation flow, animations, interactions)

- **Architecture in SwiftUI + MVVM**  
  using `ObservableObject`, `@State`, `@Binding`, `@Published`

- **Complete feature development**  
  (goal creation, weekly challenges, daily check-ins, streak logic, dashboard)

- **Local data modeling & persistence with Core Data**  
  - goal entities  
  - streak tracking  
  - check-in storage  
  - CRUD operations  
  - background saves  
  - SwiftUI integration with `@FetchRequest`  
  - lightweight migrations

- **Custom SwiftUI components**  
  (progress rings, streak counters, goal cards, animated interactions)

- **Navigation & flow design**  
  (NavigationStack, sheets, modals, onboarding)
